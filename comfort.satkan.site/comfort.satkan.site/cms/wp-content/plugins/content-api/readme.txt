Manage posts, products, SEO, and more via custom WordPress endpoints.


== Description ==
Content API offers a powerful and flexible solution for managing your site’s posts, products, SEO settings, and more through custom endpoints. By creating tailored REST API endpoints, the plugin enables you to perform actions such as updating product attributes, managing content, and even optimizing SEO all from external systems or custom-built applications.

Whether you’re managing an eCommerce store, handling content on a blog, or controlling SEO configurations, this plugin provides the tools to do it efficiently. The custom API endpoints support secure, token-based authentication to ensure only authorized users can interact with your WordPress site.

With features like bulk updates for product attributes, streamlined content management, and simplified SEO configurations, this plugin enhances the flexibility and automation of your WordPress site, making it easier to integrate with third-party tools and manage everything from a centralized platform.
